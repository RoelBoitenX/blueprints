To apply the file generated by this blueprint, execute the following command:

```
$ xl apply -f xebialabs/docker-application.yaml
```

Applying that XL YAML file will create a deployment package with a single `docker.ContainerSpec` for the container that you specified.

Instantiate and apply the companion `docker/environment` blueprint to create an environment to which this package can be deployed.

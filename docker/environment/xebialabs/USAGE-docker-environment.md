### Prerequisites

If you do not have an XL Deploy instance running, you can use the Docker Compose setup generated by the blueprint to spin it up.
Please note that you can obtain a trial license or bring your own license for XL Deploy if you like. Follow the steps below to use the Docker Compose file.

    1. CD into the folder "docker" generated by the blueprint.
    2. Run `docker-compose up` on the generated `docker` folder.


To apply the files generated by this blueprint, execute the following commands:

```
$ xl apply -f xebialabs/docker-infrastructure.yaml
$ xl apply -f xebialabs/docker-environment.yaml
```

Applying the first XL YAML file will create a `docker.Engine` infrastructure CI named docker, applying the second XL YAML file will create an environment with that infrastructure CI.

Instantiate and apply the companion `docker/application` blueprint to create an appliation that can be deployed to this environment.

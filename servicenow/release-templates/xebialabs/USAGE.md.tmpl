The blueprint supplies two yaml files with sample templates for usage with the ServiceNow application from the appstore.

If you do not have XL Release instance running, you can use the Docker Compose setup generated by the blueprint to spin it up. You will need to install the ServiceNow plugin on the XL release server. You can find more information here;
